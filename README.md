# VendingMachine

Herein is my take on the Vending Machine kata by Guy Royse (https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata), written in Java.

As the kata is specifically around writing the logic for the guts of a vending machine, this contains no I/O nor a runnable JAR.

Instead, please see the tests for viewing the functionality of the vending machine and its associated helper classes.


Thank you for your time and interest!
